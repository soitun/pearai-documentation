# ðŸš€ Usage Costs & Available Models

## What are the usage costs? (PearAI Server only)

PearAI's usage cost is measured in credits. The amount of credits used depends on the size of your input prompts, ouput responses, model used, and AI tool used (PearAI Chat, PearAI Search, PearAI Creator, etc.).

As an early access benefit, current subscribers will be grandfathered into our early bird pricing â€“ meaning you'll keep these special rates permanently. At just $15/month, our subscription provides more value than purchasing the equivalent amount in API credits directly from LLM providers, giving you access to more usage at a better price point.

> Keep in mind that longer messages and larger files use up more of your credits. Similarly, long conversations will consume your limit faster as each previous message is sent as context. It is recommended to start new chats often. By being more specific in your prompts, you will not only save more credits, but also have more precise results, as the AI will have less irrelevant data to parse through.

If you're a subscriber and you hit your monthly limit, you can easily top up for more credits in your dashboard, which never expire.

## How can I maximize my PearAI usage?

Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of PearAI:

- **Start new conversations**: When you switch to a new topic or have unrelated questions, start a fresh conversation. This helps keep your conversations manageable and optimizes your usage.
- **Avoid re-uploads**: Once you've uploaded a file, you don't need to upload it again in the same conversation. PearAI remembers the information from your earlier uploads.
- **Provide relevant context**: While PearAI can access your entire codebase, you'll get the best results by specifically including only the files that are directly related to your request. This helps PearAI focus on the most pertinent information and provide more accurate and helpful responses.

We understand that usage limits can sometimes be a bit confusing. We're always striving to improve PearAI and provide the best possible AI experience.
